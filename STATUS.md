## 2026-11-01 — Project moved to the main folder

- At Tolu's request, moved everything from `iecnn/` up one level into `/home/t85491005/IECNN` (configs, src, tests, data, spec, reports, results, scripts, checkpoints, README/STATUS/RUNBOOK/DECISIONS/requirements/.gitignore).
- `iecnn/.venv` remains in the old subfolder for now: PyTorch is still downloading into it. It will be moved to `/home/t85491005/IECNN/.venv` and its internal absolute paths fixed once the install completes.
- RUNBOOK.md paths updated to the new location.

## 2026-11-01 — Phase 0 started

- Environment detected: Linux x86_64 (kernel 6.6), 2 CPU cores, no GPU, 2.7 GB RAM, ~4.5 GB free disk.
- Default `python3` is 3.15; using system `python3.11` for the venv (torch wheel availability).
- Created venv at `iecnn/.venv`, installing PyTorch (CPU wheel) first, then the rest of the pinned requirements.
- Found spec at `papers/00..08`; concatenated into `spec/IECNN_FULL_SPEC.md` (see DECISIONS.md).
- Unzipped `iecnn_skeleton.zip`; the skeleton layout matches Section 5 of the agent prompt. Building on it.
- Reading the full spec (done: 00–08) and the skeleton stubs before writing any code.
