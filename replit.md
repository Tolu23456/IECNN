# IECNN — Replit Setup and Architecture Notes

## What this project is

IECNN (Iterative Emergent Convergent Neural Network) is a CLI-only research project
implementing a novel neural architecture. It runs entirely in the terminal
(`python main.py`), has no web server, and requires no external API keys.

---

## Running the App

```bash
python main.py             # full interactive demo (recommended)
python main.py build       # (re)compile C extensions
python main.py encode "text"
python main.py sim "text A" "text B"
python main.py compare "a" "b" "c"
python main.py memory
```

The workflow is configured to run `python main.py` via the Replit workflow named
"Start application".

---

## Dependencies

**System:** Python 3.10+, gcc (for C extensions)
**Python:** numpy (only external dependency)
**C:** compiled automatically by `build.sh` on first run

Install numpy if missing:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

Compile C extensions:
```bash
bash build.sh
```
or:
```bash
python main.py build
```

## Architecture Notes

### Neural Dots
- 6 types: SEMANTIC, STRUCTURAL, CONTEXTUAL, RELATIONAL, TEMPORAL, GLOBAL
- 3 prediction heads per dot (per-head projection matrices)
- Bias vector (5-dim): attention, granularity, abstraction, inversion, temperature
- Memory-guided attention: recent centroid from DotMemory used as query hint

### Formulas
All 15 formulas are implemented in Python (fallback) and C (primary).
C .so files use `_c.so` suffix to avoid colliding with Python module names.

### BaseMapping
- Primitives (a-z, 0-9, punct) are pre-seeded and always available
- Each token = exactly ONE matrix row (words never split into char rows)
- Unknown words → 'composed' type (weighted char-base combination)
- Feature layout: [96 embed | 8 pos | 4 freq | 16 flags | 4 ctx]

### Iteration Loop
- 5 stopping conditions (budget, dominance, novelty gain, stability, decline)
- Adaptive LR via Formula 14: eta(t) = eta_0 * (1 - 0.8 * dom²)
- Rollback to best-scoring round if final round regressed

### Evolution
- Runs between calls (not during a call)
- Uses DotMemory effectiveness scores to rank dots
- Tournament selection + mutation + crossover + random injection

---

## Constraints and Conventions

- **CLI only** — no web server, no flask, no HTTP
- **Max 10,000 lines per file**
- **Separate folder per major component** at workspace root
- **C `.so` files** named with `_c.so` suffix
- **numpy only** — no pytorch, tensorflow, or other ML frameworks
- **No backpropagation** — only bias vector update (Formula 8) and dot evolution

---

## Version

Current: **v0.4.0** — see CHANGELOG.md for full history.

## F16: Emergent Utility Gradient (EUG)

Added in v0.4.0. Replaces the broken cluster-ID-based `novelty_gain` stopping condition.

**Formula:** `U(t) = E[C_{t+1}(p)] - C_t(p)`

Estimated via recency-weighted score delta:
- 2 rounds: `U = C_t - C_{t-1}`
- 3+ rounds: `U = 0.7*(C_t - C_{t-1}) + 0.3*(C_{t-1} - C_{t-2})`

**Stopping:** if `U ≤ eug_threshold (0.001)` after ≥ 3 rounds, the system stops.

**Why the old novelty check was broken:** cluster IDs (`cluster_id`) reset to `0, 1, 2, …` each round, so `cur - prev` was always empty and `novelty_gain` was always `0.0`, triggering a stop at round 2 every time.
